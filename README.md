# Interactive-Braille-Learning

I've created an interactive Braille learning tool with the following features:

*Interactive 6-dot Braille cell that users can toggle to create patterns
*Real-time feedback on correct/incorrect patterns
*Hint system explaining dot positions
*Clean, accessible interface with high contrast
*Support for multiple letters (A-F initially, can be expanded)
*Clear instructions and visual feedback
*Mobile-responsive design

The tool is designed to be:

*Intuitive for beginners
*Visually clear with good contrast
*Interactive with immediate feedback
*Educational with helpful hints
*Accessible for all users
